# React + js test

## Goal

We want to create a guessing game where the user guesser the secret word or the words anagram (same word with displaced letters).

Display a success/error message to the user if the guess was successful / unsuccessful / too many tries.

## MVP stages

1. User submits the word through a button
2. User submits the word through the input

Nice to have - loading animation, if the request takes time

## Task

Modify `/src/App.jsx` and `/src/api/anagram.js` files as needed.
